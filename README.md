# BGG Catalog Multi-Language Board Game Card System Documentation

This repository provides detailed documentation on how to create multi-language board game card files for the "BGG Catalog" application, a board game app available on Android and iOS.

## About BGG Catalog

"BGG Catalog" is an application designed to help users manage and score their board games. The app is available on both Android and iOS platforms.

- Available on [Android](https://bit.ly/3oYT9HU)
- Available on [iPhone and iPad](https://apple.co/3f9ARRG)

## Why this repository

This repository shows how to create a multi-language board game card file for the "BGG Catalog" application. The files are in JSON format, don't worry if you are not a programmer, as they are very easy to work with.

Also this repository contains files for games that are already available in "BGG Catalog", so you will be able to:

- Create new translations for existing games
- Review translations of current games
- Create a new file for another game

Translation files must be in English to be uploaded to the application, plus any language you want to add.

## How to contribute

Just look at the documentation and send me the translation file to gadestudios@gmail.com, but first contact me to see if there is someone else doing it and not to duplicate efforts ;-)

When you send me the mail:

- You can do it in English or Spanish
- The subject should start with "CARDS - " and add the game name
